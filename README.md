# metasfresh-dev

!! MOVED TO https://github.com/metasfresh/metasfresh/tree/master_add_metasfresh-dev/misc/dev-support !!

This repository contains resources intended to help metasfresh developers:
* all our [eclipse config files](https://github.com/metasfresh/metasfresh-dev/tree/master/eclipse-config) (formatter, code cleanup, templates etc) and a documentation on how to set import them into eclipse
* a Vagrantfile to allow developers to spin up a local virtualbox machine with common infrastructure pieces. Please check out the [README.md](https://github.com/metasfresh/metasfresh-dev/blob/master/vagrant/README.md) in the `vagrant` folder for further directions on that.
